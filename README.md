## Details

- Approx. completion time: **3 hours**
- Deliverables: **2 HTML files, 2 CSS files, images**

Using the grid system (and a few small media queries), recreate the layout matching the attached screenshots.

- The `font-family` is `sans-serif`.
- Don’t worry at all about typography; no `font-size`, no `font-weight`, no `line-height`, etc.
- You’ll need `display` and `text-align` to adjust the masthead a little.
- Don’t *add* any `margin` or `padding`, just remove them if they’re causing problems with the layout.
- Try to use as few media queries as possible, in fact there should only be a couple small entries.
